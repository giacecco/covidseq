# covidseq
Covidseq is a sequencer for [VCV Rack](https://vcvrack.com), written in memoriam of the deceased because of COVID-19 in the Netherlands.

The ```covidseq.js``` script is intended to be used as configuration for [VCV Rack's "Prototype" module](https://library.vcvrack.com/VCV-Prototype/Prototype). It generates a sequence of voltages centred around C4 (0V) that can used to feed an oscillator or quantiser to create melodies. As it runs, it displays the number of deaths and the municipalities they were recorded at.

The sequence is generated by running the ```prepare-data.js``` script and copying and pasting the resulting scriptlet in ```covidseq.js```. The data is fetched at the moment the script is executed from the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment [here](https://data.rivm.nl/covid-19/). Every day the sequence will change, as long as there won't be any more deaths because of COVID-19.
