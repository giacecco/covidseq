# covidseq
A sequencer for VCV Rack, in memoriam of the deceased because of COVID-19 in the Netherlands.

```covidseq.js``` is intended to be used as input to VCV Rack's "Prototype" module. It generates a sequence of voltages that can used to feed an oscillator or quantiser to create melodies. As it runs, it displays the number of deaths and the municipalities they were recorded at.

The sequence is generated by running the ```prepare-data.js``` script and copying and pasting the resulting scriptlet in ```covidseq.js```.
